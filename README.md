# Task Manager Web Application

This is a **full-stack Task Manager web application** I built as part of my project. Iâ€™m fairly new to full-stack development, so I tried my best to make it work smoothly with **React** on the frontend and **Django REST Framework** on the backend.  

The app helps users manage tasks, subtasks, track focus sessions, and visualize productivity.

## ðŸ§© How It Works (Data Flow)

1. On page load, **AuthContext** checks if there is a valid token in `localStorage`.  
   - If yes, the user is considered logged in.  
   - Axios headers are automatically set with the token.

2. **TaskSessionContext** fetches tasks, subtasks, and focus sessions from the backend.  
   - Prevents overlapping fetches using internal flags.

3. Users can create, update, delete tasks and subtasks.  
   - Completed timestamps are automatically set.

4. **Focus sessions** are tracked per user, per task.  
   - These are then visualized in charts on the **Dashboard**.

5. Navbar shows different links depending on whether the user is logged in or not.

## ðŸ”‘ Backend Models

- **User** (Django default)
- **Task**
  - title, description, due_date, priority, completed, created_at, completed_at
- **SubTask**
  - title, completed, completed_at, linked to Task
- **FocusSession**
  - timestamp, linked to User
